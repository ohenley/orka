      --  For example:
      --
      --     1 3 4 | 2 5
      --     -----   ---
      --  acquired   released
      --
      --  To acquire a slot, we simply move the '|' between the two arrays
      --  to the right and return the Future_Object object to which the
      --  new handle is pointing. In the example we return
      --  Future_Slots (2)'Access.
      --
      --  To release a slot, we lookup the location (which is stored in the
      --  Future_Object object itself) of its handle and then swap the
      --  handle with the handle at the end of the array of acquired slots.
      --  Finally, we move the '|' to the left.
      --
      --  For example, given the above array, releasing slot 1 results in:
      --
      --       4 3 | 1 2 5
