   --  Instances is an array containing a contiguous number of instance
   --  ID's that have been added, followed by a contiguous number of ID's
   --  that have been removed. This array is used to quickly determine a
   --  free ID that can be returned by the function Add_Instance.
   --
   --  Indices is an array that is used to look up the position of an
   --  instance ID in Instances in O(1) time. Iterating over Instances
   --  would be an O(n) operation.
   --
   --  For example:
   --
   --  Instances:
   --
   --  1 3 4 | 2 5
   --  -----   ---
   --  added   removed
   --
   --  Indices:
   --
   --  1 4 2 3 5
   --
   --  To add an instance, the '|' is moved to the right and the ID next
   --  to it (2 in the example above) is returned.
   --
   --  To remove an instance, we look up the index of the instance and
   --  then swap its ID with the instance at the end of the array of
   --  added instances. Finally, we move the '|' to the left.
   --
   --  The indices of the two swapped instances are updated in Indices.
   --
   --  For example, given the above array, removing instance 1 results in:
   --
   --    4 3 | 1 2 5
   --    ---   -----
   --  added   removed
