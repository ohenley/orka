   --  This package contains some low-level types that are used by the raw C
   --  interface of the OpenGL API. They are converted to types that are easier
   --  to handle by the wrapper and thus are not needed for using the wrapper.
   --  However, they might be used by other APIs that use OpenGL and thus are
   --  exposed publicly here.

   --  Boolean with the representation used by the OpenGL API (unsigned char).
   --  Is converted to a standard Boolean by the wrapper.
   type Bool is new Boolean;

   --  This type is never used directly. However, enumerations refer to it for
   --  defining their Size attribute.
   subtype Enum is C.unsigned;

   --  Bitfields are usually converted to a record with Boolean fields in the
   --  wrapper. However, for interacting with the OpenGL library, these records
   --  are converted back to the raw Bitfield type (by means of
   --  Unchecked_Conversion). Using the record directly with the C interface
   --  requires it to have the C_Pass_By_Value conversion, which for some reason
   --  breaks linking on Windows with StdCall convention (possibly a GNAT bug).
   subtype Bitfield is C.unsigned;

   type Single_Array is array (Positive range <>) of aliased Single;

   type Int_Array  is array (Positive range <>) of aliased Int;
