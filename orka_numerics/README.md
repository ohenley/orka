# orka_numerics

This crate provides:

- Runge-Kutta 4th order [numerical integrators][url-docs-integrators].

- Sigma-point [Kalman filters][url-docs-kalman] (UKF and SR-CDKF) for
  state and parameter estimation.

- [Tensor][url-docs-tensors] interface with the following features:

  * Constant indexing using a number, range, or another (boolean) tensor
  * Matrix multiplication, power, inverse, transpose, outer product
  * Matrix decompositions like QR, Cholesky
  * Solve equations like Ax = b or find (constrained) least-squares solutions
  * Vector normalization and standardization
  * Constructors to create tensors from arrays, filled w/ zeros or ones
  * Constructors to create a range of numbers, or linear/log/geom space
  * Constructors to create an identity matrix, or with a diagonal
  * Reshape, flatten, or concatenate tensors
  * Element-wise operations (arithmetic, rounding, trigonometry, compare)
  * Reductions using arbitrary expressions
  * Statistics (operations and generating statistical distributions)
  * Logical operations on boolean tensors

Two crates exist which implement the `Tensor` interface: one which uses
SIMD instructions on the CPU and one which uses buffers and computer shaders
on the GPU.
