package Orka.Numerics.Kalman.CDKF is
   pragma Preelaborate;

   --  This package implements the state estimation form with additive noise
   --  of the square-root Central Difference Kalman Filter, Algorithm 13 from [1]
   --
   --  (See package Orka.Numerics.Kalman.SPKF for reference [1])

   function Weights (N : Positive; H2 : Tensors.Element_Type) return Weights_Type
     with Pre => H2 >= 1.0;
   --  Return a set of weights for the sigma points for the CDKF
   --
   --  H2 is the square of the interval size and should be chosen such
   --  that it is equal to the kurtosis of the state's distribution. The
   --  kurtosis is equal to the excess kurtosis + 3. For a Gaussian (normal
   --  distribution), the excess kurtosis is 0, so H2 = 3.
