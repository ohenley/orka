# Shape and axes

Each tensor has a shape, the number of elements in each axis,
of the type `Tensor_Shape`; an indefinite array of natural numbers.
For example, the shape of a 2 Ã— 3 matrix is `:::ada (2, 3)` and the shape
of a vector of 100 elements is `:::ada (1 => 100)`.

The shape of a tensor can be retrieved using the function `Shape` and
the axes with the function `Axes`. The total number of
elements in the tensor is queried with the function `Elements`.

The functions `Rows` returns the number of elements for a 1-D tensor (vector)
or rows of a 2-D tensor (matrix). `Columns` requires a tensor with at
least two axes and returns the number of columns.

!!! summary
    It is true that `:::ada T.Shape'Length = T.Axes` and
    `:::ada Elements (T.Shape) = T.Elements` for a tensor `T`.

##  Image

The image of a tensor can be obtained with the function `Image`:

```ada
Orka.OS.Put_Line (Tensor.Image);
```

## Changing the shape

Sometimes the shape of a tensor needs to be changed.
For example, `:::ada Tensor (Tensor mod 2.0 = 0.0)` returns a 1-D tensor.
The function `Reshape` can be used to create a new tensor that has the given
shape and the elements of the original tensor. The function can be given
either a shape or the number of elements:

```ada
Tensor_1 : constant CPU_Tensor := To_Tensor ((1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0));
Tensor_2 : constant CPU_Tensor := Tensor_1.Reshape ((2, 3));
```

The given shape or size must match the number of elements of the tensor.
Elements cannot be removed or added by providing a shape or size that is
smaller or larger than the current size of the tensor.

Calling `Reshape` with the current number of elements as the first parameter
will just flatten the tensor to a 1-D tensor. This is a common operation, and
you can call the function `Flatten` instead if you want, which will do the
same thing.

## Concatenating

Concatenating tensors is possible with the operator `&`. This will concatenate
two tensors in the first axis, increasing the number of rows to the sum of
the rows of the two tensors. For multidimensional tensors, the size of the first
axis (the number of rows) can be different, but the size of the other
axes must be equal.

The result of concatenating two vectors with the `&` operator is another vector:

```ada
Tensor_1 : constant CPU_Tensor := To_Tensor ((1.0, 2.0));
Tensor_2 : constant CPU_Tensor := To_Tensor ((3.0, 4.0, 5.0));

Tensor_3 : constant CPU_Tensor := Tensor_1 & Tensor_2;
```

The image of `Tensor_3` will be:

```
tensor([ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
```

The function `Concatenate` can be used to concatenate tensors in axes
other than the first axis by specifying the parameter `Dimension`.
For example, given the following two tensors:

```ada
Tensor_1 : constant CPU_Tensor := Diagonal ((1.0, 2.0, 3.0));
Tensor_2 : constant CPU_Tensor := To_Tensor ((4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0), (3, 2));
```

The tensors can be concatenated horizontally with:

```ada
Tensor_3 : constant CPU_Tensor := Tensor_1.Concatenate (Tensor_2, Dimension => 2);
```

The image of `Tensor_3` will be:

```
tensor([[ 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 4.0, 5.0],
        [ 0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 6.0, 7.0],
        [ 0.0, 0.0, 3.0, 8.0, 9.0]])
```

The `&` operator would have concatenated the tensors vertically,
as if `Concatenate` was called with `Dimension` set to 1:

```ada
Tensor_4 : constant CPU_Tensor := Tensor_2.Reshape ((2, 3));
Tensor_5 : constant CPU_Tensor := Tensor_1 & Tensor_4;
```

The image of `Tensor_3` will be:

```
tensor([[ 1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
        [ 0.0, 2.0, 0.0],
        [ 0.0, 0.0, 3.0],
        [ 4.0, 5.0, 6.0],
        [ 7.0, 8.0, 9.0]])
```
